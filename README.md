## Title
TSA-GA Net: A Dual Attention Mechanism for Predicting Real Estate Transaction Prices

## Overview
This journal introduces the Time Series Attention-Geographic Attention Network (TSA-GA Net), a novel approach that combines temporal and spatial attention mechanisms to significantly improve predictive accuracy in irregular and sparse real estate transaction prices.
-	Time Series Attention: Captures the dynamic price fluctuations of individual real estate properties over time, providing a deeper understanding of temporal patterns.
-	Geographic Attention: Leverages spatial relationships and price trends within the same district, integrating local market influences for enhanced predictive performance.
